  "Show notes played from a MIDI keyboard in the console.

  Uses the Java MIDI API and the system default MIDI device. (In
  practice, the default device seems to be the first one that was
  plugged in and turned on).

  The system is not 'plug-and-play' sensitive so if you plug in or
  turn on a MIDI device you need to restart the app in order to be
  able to play the new device."
